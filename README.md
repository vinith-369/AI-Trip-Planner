# Multi-Agent Travel Planner AI

A **modular, multi-agent travel planning system** built with LangChain, LangGraph, and Google Gemini LLM. This project generates structured travel plans including **hotels, transport, activities, events, weather forecasts, food recommendations, and budget breakdowns**.

The system uses a **supervised multi-agent architecture**: each agent handles a distinct part of the planning process, and a **supervisor agent** orchestrates the workflow to ensure completion and consistency.
